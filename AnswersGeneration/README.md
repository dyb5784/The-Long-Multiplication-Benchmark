# Multiplication Steps Generator

This Python script generates a detailed step-by-step breakdown of the multiplication process for two given integers. It illustrates each step of the traditional long multiplication algorithm, including intermediate results, column-by-column additions, and the final result. This can be particularly useful for educational purposes or for debugging arithmetic operations.

## Functions

### `generate_multiplication_steps(a, b)`
Generates a detailed breakdown of the multiplication process for two integers `a` and `b`.

**Parameters:**
- `a` (int): The first integer.
- `b` (int): The second integer.

**Returns:**
- `str`: A detailed description of the multiplication process.

### `sample_multiplication_steps(min_digits, max_digits, samples_per_size)`
Generates sample multiplications for numbers with a range of digit lengths and computes the average length of the generated descriptions.

**Parameters:**
- `min_digits` (int): Minimum number of digits for the sampled numbers.
- `max_digits` (int): Maximum number of digits for the sampled numbers.
- `samples_per_size` (int): Number of samples to generate per digit length.

## Usage

To use the script, call the `generate_multiplication_steps` function with two integers as arguments. For example:

```python
print(generate_multiplication_steps(523, 421))
```

This will output a detailed breakdown of the multiplication process for 523 and 421.

To generate and analyze samples, call the `sample_multiplication_steps` function:

```python
sample_multiplication_steps(1, 7, 25)
```

This will generate multiplication steps for numbers with digit lengths ranging from 1 to 7, with 25 samples per digit length, and print a DataFrame showing the average length of the generated descriptions.

## Example Output

```plaintext
Calculating:

    523
x   421
-------------

Step 1: Calculate for the 1st digit from the right (1):

1 * 523 = ?

1 * 3 = 3 (shift whole number 1 step left)
1 * 2 = 20 (shift whole number 1 step left)
1 * 5 = 500 (shift whole number 1 step left)

Intermediate column summary after this step:

Column 1: 3 = 3
Column 2: 2 = 2
Column 3: 5 = 5

Step 1 result: 523

...

Sum everything up:

    000523
    010460
    209200

Column by column addition:
Column 1: 3 + 0 + 0 = 3
Column 2: 2 + 6 + 0 = 8
Column 3: 5 + 4 + 2 = 1 (1 is carried)
Column 4: 0 + 0 + 9 = 0 (1 is carried)
Column 5: 0 + 1 + 0 = 2
Column 6: 0 + 0 + 2 = 2

Final result: 220183
